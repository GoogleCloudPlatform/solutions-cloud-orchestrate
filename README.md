# Cloud Orchestrate

## About the project

**Cloud Orchestrate** makes it easy to deploy and manage fleets of virtual workstations and entire production systems on Google Cloud with a high-level API. 

Cloud Orchestrate is intended for content creation workloads such as VFX/animation, ArchViz, game development, manufacturing and engineering, or any industry workload that requires access to powerful virtual workstations. Resources can be distributed in any region for low-latency performance anywhere in the world, and storage strategies can be defined to allow global access to common assets.

Cloud Orchestrate is a solution that includes open source software, cloud-native services, and third-party software products such as Teradici [Cloud Access Software](https://www.teradici.com/solutions-services/cloud-access-plus) and [Cloud Access Manager](https://www.teradici.com/web-help/pcoip_cloud_access_manager/CACv2/).

## Getting started

See the [wiki](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-cloud-orchestrate/wiki) for full documentation.

## Prerequisites

To deploy Cloud Orchestrate, you should have access to and a basic working knowledge of Google Cloud Platform and are familiar with [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) and the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
